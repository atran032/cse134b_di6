      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>You'll notice that this website is similar to the Portfolio I'm making. 
        My goal for this is to experiment with making a more minimal Portfolio 
        using custom Astro elements. Apologies if you were expecting something
        more like a blog.</p>

      <p>My love of computers developed early, when I first got my hands on the family computer. 
        Ever since, it took off, and I was learning rudimentary programming since the 3rd grade. 
        I love to learn the subject <i>and</i> I love to teach it too. My fondness of computers 
        is also related to my love of <em>video games</em>, but I dabble in many non-digital 
        interests as well. I love to <em>hike</em>, I <em>bake</em>, I practice <em>fencing</em>, 
        and I love to study <em>history</em>, particularly of the medieval eras.</p>
